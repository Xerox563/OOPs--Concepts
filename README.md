# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts 📚

This repository is dedicated to the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It covers essential topics such as:

- **Classes and Objects** 🏫
- **Inheritance** 🧬
- **Polymorphism** 🔄
- **Encapsulation** 🔒
- **Abstraction** 🎭

## Repository Overview

This repository includes detailed explanations, examples, and practical applications of OOP concepts. Whether you're a beginner learning OOP or someone looking to brush up on key principles, this repository provides a comprehensive guide to get you started.

### Key Concepts:

- **Classes and Objects**: The blueprint for creating objects and instances.
- **Inheritance**: The mechanism where one class can inherit properties and methods from another class.
- **Polymorphism**: The ability for different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through inheritance.
- **Encapsulation**: The bundling of data and methods that operate on the data within one unit, restricting direct access to some of the object’s components.
- **Abstraction**: The concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Familiarity with any programming language (though the examples are tailored for OOP in languages like Java, Python, C++, etc.)
